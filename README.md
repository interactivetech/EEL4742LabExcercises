# EEL4742 Lab Excercises
This is a repository of the EEL4742 course lab coding exercises I co-completed on the MSP-EXP430G2 development board, written in C and Assembly 

There are 4 labs, and each lab contains:

    - A Lab Report that explains the tasks requested to execute on the MSP-EXP430G2 and describes the code implmentations in more detail

    - C code that implements the tasks requested in the Lab Assignment

    - Assembly code that implements the tasks requested in the Lab Assignment

Organized and Completed by Andrew Mendez and Daniel Franco
